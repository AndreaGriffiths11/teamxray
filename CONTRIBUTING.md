# 🤝 Contributing to MCP Team X-Ray

> *"Just like our tool reveals the humans behind the code, we want to reveal the humans behind this project."*

Thank you for considering contributing to Team X-Ray! We're building something special — a tool that helps developers discover the brilliant minds on their teams. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes our community stronger.

## 🌟 **Our Philosophy**

We believe in **human-centered development**:
- **Code quality matters**, but so does developer experience
- **Technical excellence** should feel approachable and inclusive  
- **Documentation** should be clear, helpful, and encouraging
- **Community** grows through kindness and mutual support

## 🚀 **Quick Start for Contributors**

   code .
   
   # Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
   # This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded
   ```

## 🎯 **How to Contribute**

### **1. 🐛 Bug Reports**

Found something that doesn't work as expected? Help us fix it!

**Before reporting:**
- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/team-xray/issues)
- Try with the latest version
- Test with a minimal reproduction case

**Great bug reports include:**
- Clear description of what happened vs. what you expected
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Your environment (VS Code version, OS, repository size)
- Screenshots or error messages
- Sample repository (if possible)

### **2. ✨ Feature Requests**

Have an idea for making Team X-Ray even better at revealing team expertise?

**Feature requests should:**
- Align with our human-centered mission
- Include specific use cases
- Consider the developer experience
- Explain the expected behavior

### **3. 🔧 Code Contributions**

Ready to dive into the code? Here's how to make impactful contributions:

#### **Good First Issues**

Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/AndreaGriffiths11/team-xray/labels/good%20first%20issue):
- Documentation improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- Error message improvements
- Test coverage additions

#### **Development Workflow**

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Test thoroughly with the Extension Development Host

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # We use conventional commits
   git commit -m "feat: add expert communication style analysis"
   git commit -m "fix: handle empty repository gracefully"
   git commit -m "docs: update MCP setup instructions"
   ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch to your fork
   - Open a PR against the `main` branch
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues

## 📋 **Coding Standards**

### **Code Style**

We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### **TypeScript Guidelines**

- **Use strict mode** — no `any` types without good reason
- **Prefer explicit types** for public APIs
- **Use meaningful variable names** — `expertiseAnalysis` over `data`
- **Document complex logic** with clear comments

### **VS Code Extension Best Practices**

- **Handle errors gracefully** — show helpful messages to users
- **Use progress indicators** for long-running operations
- **Respect VS Code theming** — use CSS variables for colors
- **Test in both light and dark themes**
- **Follow VS Code UX patterns** — use familiar icons and layouts

### **Human-Centered Code**

Since our tool focuses on humans, our code should too:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - reveals human insights
const communicationStyle = expert.commitMessages.length > averageLength 
  ? "Detailed and thorough" 
  : "Concise and focused";

// ❌ Avoid - just technical metrics  
const messageLength = expert.commitMessages.reduce(...);
```

## 🧪 **Testing Guidelines**

### **Test Categories**

1. **Unit Tests** — Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests** — Test MCP server integration
3. **Extension Tests** — Test VS Code extension functionality
4. **Manual Testing** — Test with real repositories

### **Writing Good Tests**

```typescript
// ✅ Good test - clear and focused
describe('ExpertiseAnalyzer', () => {
  it('should identify communication styles from commit patterns', async () => {
    const commits = createMockCommits({
      detailed: ['feat: add comprehensive error handling with user feedback'],
      concise: ['fix: typo']
    });
    
    const analysis = await analyzer.analyzeCommits(commits);
    
    expect(analysis.communicationStyle).toBe('Mixed - detailed for features, concise for fixes');
  });
});
```
