# 🤝 Code of Conduct

## **Our Commitment**

Team X-Ray is built on the belief that **every person brings unique value to a team**. Just as our tool reveals the hidden strengths of developers, we're committed to creating a community where everyone's contributions are recognized, respected, and celebrated.

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
